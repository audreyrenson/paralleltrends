Description: This package implements the estimators described in the paper titled
            'Identifying and estimating effects of sustained treatments under parallel trends assumptions', 
            along with a small simulation (also described in that paper) to illustrate approximate large-sample 
            properties of the estimators, code and data for the application to COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.
